# PushRock

PushRock is a puzzle game inspired by the classic game Sokoban and blends in mechanics borrowed from the Portal franchise. The goal in the game is to activate all the pressure plates on the map by placing either the player character or movable rocks on top of them. This pursuit is made more complex by requiring clever use of various tools such as portals, teleporters, and a gravity inverter.
